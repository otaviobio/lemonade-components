    title: "How do I add another pet?",
    content: "Each pet needs their own policy, but you'll need to set them up one at a time. After purchasing a policy for your first pet, just hit the + symbol on your Lemonade app's home screen to get a new quote for your other furry friend - and get a 5% discount!"
  },
  {
    title: "What are waiting periods?",
    content: "Like all pet insurers, we have waiting periods before certain coverages kick in - 2 days for accidents, 14 days for illnesses, and 6 months for cruciate ligament events. But if you opted for our preventative package, you can use the benefits in that package the day after you purchased the policy!"
  },
  {
    title: "Do you need my pet's medical records?",
    content: "We want to get to know your pet so we can provide the best experience. After you purchase your policy, we'll ask for your pet's medical records, which show vital information and help us understand if your pet has previous health issues, aka pre-existing conditions. This will also help speed up the process when reviewing your claim!"
  },
  {
    title: "What are pre-existing conditions and are they covered?",
    content: "Anything your pet has shown signs of before the policy's waiting periods are up is considered a pre-existing condition. Currently, we don't cover pre-existing conditions, but we've got your back in case of accidents and any new illnesses, as part of our base coverage."
  },
  {
    title: "How will I get paid for a claim?",
    content: "We'll ask you to enter your bank account information as part of submitting your claim in the Lemonade app. Once it's approved, we'll issue payment directly into your account."
  },
  {
    title: "Can I go to any vet?",
    content: "You can go to any vet you like in the US. As long as they're licensed to provide veterinary care in the state they operate in, it's fair game."
  },
  {
    title: "Are there discounts or bundles available?",
    content: "Yes! If you're an existing Lemonade customer you'll get a 10% discount for bundling, and if you insure more than one pet you'll get a 5% multi-pet discount. You can also get a 5% discount by paying annually instead of monthly - plus, you'll save the $1 monthly installment fee."
  },
  {
    title: "Can I change my policy later?",
    content: "You can submit a request to modify your coverage within the first 14 days of your policy, and again at your policy's annual renewal. Once requested, we'll let you know if the changes are approved by our underwriting team."
  },
  {
    title: "Can I cancel my policy at any time?",
    content: "Yes, you can cancel your policy at any time through the Lemonade app. Keep in mind that our waiting periods will reset, and anything that occurred or was diagnosed during your first policy would be considered pre-existing conditions on a future policy."
